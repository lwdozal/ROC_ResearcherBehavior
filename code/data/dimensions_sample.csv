9612,9612,100,dataset.8628606,10.1371/journal.pone.0134484,A Multiplex Label-Free Approach to Avian Influenza Surveillance and Serology,"Influenza serology has traditionally relied on techniques such as hemagglutination inhibition, microneutralization, and ELISA. These assays are complex, challenging to implement in a format allowing detection of several types of antibody-analyte interactions at once (multiplex), and troublesome to implement in the field. As an alternative, we have developed a hemagglutinin microarray on the Arrayed Imaging Reflectometry (AIR) platform. AIR provides sensitive, rapid, and label-free multiplex detection of targets in complex analyte samples such as serum. In preliminary work, we demonstrated the application of this array to the testing of human samples from a vaccine trial. Here, we report the application of an expanded label-free hemagglutinin microarray to the analysis of avian serum samples. Samples from influenza virus challenge experiments in mallards yielded strong, selective detection of antibodies to the challenge antigen in most cases. Samples acquired in the field from mallards were also analyzed, and compared with viral hemagglutinin inhibition and microneutralization assays. We find that the AIR hemagglutinin microarray can provide a simple and robust alternative to standard methods, offering substantially greater information density from a simple workflow.",Public Library of Science,8/4/2015,2015,Joseph Bucukovski; Neus Latorre-Margalef; David E.

Yet below the cortex there is considerable sub-cortical processing that could influence beat perception. Some biases, such as a tempo preference and an audio frequency bias for beat timing, could result from sub-cortical processing. Here, we used models of the auditory-nerve and midbrain-level amplitude modulation filtering to simulate sub-cortical neural activity to various beat-inducing stimuli, and we used the simulated activity to determine the tempo or beat frequency of the music. First, irrespective of the stimulus being presented, the preferred tempo was around 100 beats per minute, which is within the range of tempi where tempo discrimination and tapping accuracy are optimal. Second, sub-cortical processing predicted a stronger influence of lower audio frequencies on beat perception. However, the tempo identification algorithm that was optimized for simple stimuli often failed for recordings of music. For music, the most highly synchronized model activity occurred at a multiple of the beat frequency. Using bottom-up processes alone is insufficient to produce beat-locked activity. Instead, a learned and possibly top-down mechanism that scales the synchronization frequency to derive the beat frequency greatly improves the performance of tempo identification.",Frontiers,5/29/2018,2018,Nathaniel J.

There is evidence that BM microenvironment contains hypoxic areas that confer survival advantage to hematopoietic cells. In the present study we investigated whether hypoxia in leukemic BM contributes to the protective role of the BM microenvironment. We observed a marked expansion of hypoxic BM areas in immunodeficient mice engrafted with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Consistent with this finding, we found that hypoxia promotes chemoresistance in various ALL derived cell lines. These findings suggest to employ hypoxia-activated prodrugs to eliminate leukemia cells within hypoxic niches. Using several xenograft models, we demonstrated that administration of the hypoxia-activated dinitrobenzamide mustard, PR-104 prolonged survival and decreased leukemia burden of immune-deficient mice injected with primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Together, these findings strongly suggest that targeting hypoxia in leukemic BM is feasible and may significantly improve leukemia therapy.

Complexes and Their Use in the Catalytic Hydrodefluorination
of Fluorocarbons","Transition metal fluoride complexes are of interest because they are potentially useful in a
multitude of catalytic applications, including C−F bond activation and fluorocarbon functionalization. We
report the first crystallographically characterized examples of molecular iron(II) fluorides:  [LMeFe(μ-F)]2
(12) and LtBuFeF (2) (L = bulky β-diketiminate). These complexes react with donor molecules (L‘), yielding
trigonal-pyramidal complexes LRFeF(L‘). The fluoride ligand is activated by the Lewis acid Et2O·BF3, forming
LtBuFe(OEt2)(η1-BF4) (3), and is also silaphilic, reacting with silyl compounds such as Me3SiSSiMe3,
Me3SiCCSiMe3, and Et3SiH to give new thiolate LtBuFeSSiMe3 (4), acetylide LtBuFeCCSiMe3 (5), and hydride
[LMeFe(μ-H)]2 (62) complexes. The hydrodefluorination (HDF) of perfluorinated aromatic compounds
(hexafluorobenzene, pentafluoropyridine, and octafluorotoluene) with a silane R3SiH (R3 = (EtO)3, Et3, Ph3,
(3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)Me2) is catalyzed by addition of an iron(II) fluoride complex, giving mainly the singly
hydrodefluorinated products (pentafluorobenzene, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoropyridine, and α,α,α,2,3,5,6-heptafluorotoluene, respectively) in up to five turnovers. These catalytic perfluoroarene HDF reactions proceed with
activation of the C−F bond para to the most electron-withdrawing group and are dependent on the degree
of fluorination and solvent polarity. Kinetic studies suggest that hydride generation is the rate-limiting step
in the HDF of octafluorotoluene, but the active intermediate is unknown. Mechanistic considerations argue
against oxidative addition and outer-sphere electron transfer pathways for perfluoroarene HDF. Fluorinated
olefins are also hydrodefluorinated (up to 10 turnovers for hexafluoropropene), most likely through a hydride
insertion/β-fluoride elimination mechanism. Complexes 12 and 2 thus provide a rare example of a
homogeneous system that activates C−F bonds without competitive C−H activation and use an inexpensive
3d transition metal.",American Chemical Society,6/1/2005,2005,Javier Vela; Jeremy M. Smith; Ying Yu; Nicole A. Ketterer; Christine J. Flaschenriem; Rene J. Lachicotte; Patrick L.

of Polyoxovanadate Clusters:
Atomically Precise Models for Electronic Effects of Anion Doping in
VO<sub>2</sub>","We report the synthesis and characterization of a monochloride-functionalized
poly­oxo­vanadate-alkoxide (POV-alkoxide) cluster, which
can serve as a molecular model for halogen-doped vanadium oxide (VO2) materials that have recently attracted great interest as
advanced materials for energy-saving smart window applications. Chloride-substituted
variants of the Lindqvist vanadium-oxide cluster were obtained via
two distinct chemical pathways: (1) direct halogenation of the isovalent
parent POV-alkoxide architecture, [V6O7(OC2H5)12]−2 with AlCl3 and (2) coordination of a chloride ion to a coordinatively
unsaturated vanadium center within a cluster that bears a single oxygen-atom
vacancy, [V6O6(OC2H5)12]0. Notably, our direct halogenation constitutes
the first example of selective, single-site halide doping of homometallic
metal oxide clusters. The chloride-containing compound, [V6O6Cl­(OC2H5)12]−1, was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.
The electronic structure of the chloride-functionalized POV-alkoxide
cluster was established by infrared, electronic absorption, and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy and revealed formation of a site-differentiated
VIII ion upon halogenation. Cyclic voltammetry was employed
to assess the electrochemical response of halide doping. A comparison
of the Cl-VO2 model to the fully oxygenated cluster, [V6O7(OC2H5)12]−2, provides molecular-level insights into a new proposed
mechanism by which halogenation increases the carrier density in solid
VO2, namely, through prompting charge separation within
the material.",American Chemical Society,12/18/2019,2019,"Brittney

hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) gas-drilling operations
in the Marcellus Play have raised environmental concerns, including
the risk of groundwater contamination. Fingerprinting water impacted
by gas-drilling operations is not trivial given other potential sources
of contamination. We present a multivariate statistical modeling framework
for developing a quantitative, geochemical fingerprinting tool to
distinguish sources of high salinity in shallow groundwater. The model
was developed using new geochemical data for 204 wells in New York
State (NYS), which has a HVHF moratorium and published data for additional
wells in NYS and several salinity sources (Appalachian Basin brines,
road salt, septic effluent, and animal waste). The model incorporates
a stochastic simulation to predict the geochemistry of high salinity
(>20 mg/L Cl) groundwater impacted by different salinity sources
and
then employs linear discriminant analysis to classify samples from
different populations. Model results indicate Appalachian Basin brines
are the primary source of salinity in 35% of sampled NYS groundwater
wells with >20 mg/L Cl. The model provides an effective means for
differentiating groundwater impacted by basin brines versus other
contaminants. Using this framework, similar discriminatory tools can
be derived for other regions from background water quality data.",American Chemical Society,8/19/2014,2014,"Laura K. Lautz; Gregory

Addition of 1-adamantyl azide to an iron(I) source gives the tetrazene complex LMeFe(AdNNNNAd), most likely through an imidoiron(III) intermediate. Spectroscopic, magnetic, crystallographic, and computational investigations of the tetrazene complex show that one unpaired spin occupies a primarily ligand-based orbital, and is antiferromagnetically coupled to a high-spin iron(II) ion to give an S = 3/2 ground state. Reversible single-electron reduction occurs at the ligand singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO), affording a dianionic tetrazene ligand while leaving the metal oxidation state and spin state unchanged.",American Chemical Society,6/1/2009,2009,Ryan E.

Dehydrogenative C–C Coupling by a
Pincer-Ligated Iridium Complex","The
pincer-iridium fragment (iPrPCP)Ir (RPCP = κ3-2,6-C6H3­(CH2PR2)2) has been found to catalyze the
dehydrogenative coupling of vinyl arenes to afford predominantly (E,E)-1,4-diaryl-1,3-butadienes. The eliminated
hydrogen can undergo addition to another molecule of vinyl arene,
resulting in an overall disproportionation reaction with 1 equiv of
ethyl arene formed for each equivalent of diaryl­butadiene produced.
Alternatively, sacrificial hydrogen acceptors (e.g., tert-butyl­ethylene) can be added to the solution for this purpose.
Diaryl­butadienes are isolated in moderate to good yields, up
to ca. 90% based on the disproportionation reaction. The results of
DFT calculations and experiments with substituted styrenes indicate
that the coupling proceeds via double C–H addition of a styrene
molecule, at β-vinyl and ortho-aryl positions,
to give an iridium­(III) metallo­indene intermediate; this intermediate
then adds a β-vinyl C–H bond of a second styrene molecule
before reductively eliminating product. Several metallo­indene
complexes have been isolated and crystallographically characterized.
In accord with the proposed mechanism, substitution at the ortho-aryl positions of the styrene precludes dehydrogenative
homocoupling. In the case of 2,4,6-trimethyl­styrene, dehydrogenative
coupling of β-vinyl and ortho-methyl C–H
bonds affords dimethyl­indene, demonstrating that the dehydrogenative
coupling is not limited to C­(sp2)–H bonds.",American Chemical Society,6/8/2017,2017,Miles Wilklow-Marnell; Bo Li; Tian Zhou; Karsten Krogh-Jespersen; William W. Brennessel; Thomas J. Emge; Alan S.

The capacity for rapid effector cytokine response from extralymphoid tissue-memory T cells suggests these cells may perform a ‘sentinel’ function in the tissue. While it has been demonstrated that extralymphoid CD4+ T cells can directly respond to secondary infection, little is known about how rapidly this response is initiated, and how early activation of T cells in the tissue may affect the innate response to infection. Here we use a mouse model of secondary heterosubtypic influenza infection to show that CD4+ T cells in the lung airways are reactivated within 24 hours of secondary challenge. Airway CD4+ T cells initiate an inflammatory cytokine and chemokine program that both alters the composition of the early innate response and contributes to the reduction of viral titers in the lung. These results show that, unlike a primary infection, extralymphoid tissue-memory CD4+ T cells respond alongside the innate response during secondary infection, thereby shaping the overall immune profile in the airways. These data provide new insights into the role of extralymphoid CD4+ T cells during secondary immune responses. ",Public Library of Science,5/27/2011,2011,Timothy J. Chapman; Kris Lambert; David J.

FASD lead to physical, behavioral, and cognitive impairments, including deficits related to the cerebellum. There is no known cure for FASD and their mechanisms remain poorly understood. To better understand these mechanisms, we examined the cerebellum on a cellular level by studying microglia, the principal immune cells of the central nervous system, and Purkinje cells, the sole output of the cerebellum. Both cell types have been shown to be affected in models of FASD, with increased cell death, immune activation of microglia, and altered firing in Purkinje cells. While ethanol administered in adulthood can acutely depress the dynamics of the microglial process arbor, it is unknown how developmental ethanol exposure impacts microglia dynamics and their interactions with Purkinje cells in the long term.MethodsTo address this question, we used a mouse model of human 3rd trimester exposure, whereby L7cre/Ai9+/−/Cx3cr1G/+ mice (with fluorescently labeled microglia and Purkinje cells) of both sexes were subcutaneously treated with a binge-level dose of ethanol (5.0 g/kg/day) or saline from postnatal days 4–9. Cranial windows were implanted in adolescent mice above the cerebellum to examine the long-term effects of developmental ethanol exposure on cerebellar microglia and Purkinje cell interactions using in vivo two-photon imaging.ResultsWe found that cerebellar microglia dynamics and morphology were not affected after developmental ethanol exposure. Microglia dynamics were also largely unaltered with respect to how they interact with Purkinje cells, although subtle changes in these interactions were observed in females in the molecular layer of the cerebellum.DiscussionThis work suggests that there are limited in vivo long-term effects of ethanol exposure on microglia morphology, dynamics, and neuronal interactions, so other avenues of research may be important in elucidating the mechanisms of FASD.",Frontiers,5/5/2023,2023,MaKenna Y.

complexes possess the expected pyramidal geometries, with progressively
longer M–N bond distances from P to Bi but closely similar

of 1–4 also display distortions that
are similar to those in f-element M­[N­(SiMe3)2]3 and M­[CH­(SiMe3)2]3 complexes, in which M···(β-Si–C) interactions
have been identified. Such structural features include distorted M–(N,CH)–Si

there are no M···(β-Si–C) interactions

to result from the particular steric crowding that arises in pyramidal

How the X chromosome is regulated in the Drosophila melanogaster male germline is unclear. Here we report three new findings concerning gene expression from the X in Drosophila testes. First, X chromosome-wide dosage compensation appears to be absent from most of the Drosophila male germline. Second, microarray analysis provides no evidence for X chromosome-specific inactivation during meiosis. Third, we confirm the previous discovery that the expression of transgene reporters driven by autosomal spermatogenesis-specific promoters is strongly reduced when inserted on the X chromosome versus the autosomes; but we show that this chromosomal difference in expression is established in premeiotic cells and persists in meiotic cells. The magnitude of the X-autosome difference in transgene expression cannot be explained by the absence of dosage compensation, suggesting that a previously unrecognized mechanism limits expression from the X during spermatogenesis in Drosophila. These findings help to resolve several previously conflicting reports and have implications for patterns of genome evolution and speciation in Drosophila.

Although key hyperinflammation-based organ dysfunctions that drive disease pathology have been recognized, our understanding of the factors that predispose patients to septic mortality is limited. Due to the lack of reliable prognostic measures, the development of appropriate clinical management that improves patient survival remains challenging. Here, we discovered that a subpopulation of CD49chigh neutrophils with dramatic upregulation of the complement component 1q (C1q) gene expression arises during severe sepsis. We further found that deceased septic patients failed to maintain C1q protein expression in their neutrophils, whereas septic survivors expressed higher levels of C1q. In mouse sepsis models, blocking C1q with neutralizing antibodies or conditionally knocking out C1q in neutrophils led to a significant increase in septic mortality. Apoptotic neutrophils release C1q to control their own clearance in critically injured organs during sepsis; thus, treatment of septic mice with C1q drastically increased survival. These results suggest that neutrophil C1q is a reliable prognostic biomarker of septic mortality and a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of sepsis.",Frontiers,8/2/2022,2022,Alissa Trzeciak; Raj Kumar Mongre; Ma Rie Kim; Kihong Lim; Rafael A.

In the absence of pathological insult, their highly motile processes continually survey the brain parenchyma and transiently contact synaptic elements. Aside from monitoring, their physiological roles at synapses are not known. To gain insight into possible roles of microglia in the modification of synaptic structures, we used immunocytochemical electron microscopy, serial section electron microscopy with three-dimensional reconstructions, and two-photon in vivo imaging to characterize microglial interactions with synapses during normal and altered sensory experience, in the visual cortex of juvenile mice. During normal visual experience, most microglial processes displayed direct apposition with multiple synapse-associated elements, including synaptic clefts. Microglial processes were also distinctively surrounded by pockets of extracellular space. In terms of dynamics, microglial processes localized to the vicinity of small and transiently growing dendritic spines, which were typically lost over 2 d. When experience was manipulated through light deprivation and reexposure, microglial processes changed their morphology, showed altered distributions of extracellular space, displayed phagocytic structures, apposed synaptic clefts more frequently, and enveloped synapse-associated elements more extensively. While light deprivation induced microglia to become less motile and changed their preference of localization to the vicinity of a subset of larger dendritic spines that persistently shrank, light reexposure reversed these behaviors. Taken together, these findings reveal different modalities of microglial interactions with synapses that are subtly altered by sensory experience. These findings suggest that microglia may actively contribute to the experience-dependent modification or elimination of a specific subset of synapses in the healthy brain.",Public Library of Science,11/2/2010,2010,Marie-Ève Tremblay; Rebecca L.

of Micheliolide and its Targeted Proteome in Leukemia Cells via Probe-Guided
Late-Stage C–H Functionalization","The plant-derived
sesquiterpene lactone micheliolide was recently
found to possess promising antileukemic activity, including the ability
to target and kill leukemia stem cells. Efforts toward improving the
biological activity of micheliolide and investigating its mechanism
of action have been hindered by the paucity of preexisting functional
groups amenable for late-stage derivatization of this molecule. Here,
we report the implementation of a probe-based P450 fingerprinting
strategy to rapidly evolve engineered P450 catalysts useful for the
regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation of micheliolide at two previously
inaccessible aliphatic positions in this complex natural product.
Via P450-mediated chemoenzymatic synthesis, a broad panel of novel
micheliolide analogs could thus be obtained to gain structure–activity
insights into the effect of C2, C4, and C14 substitutions on the antileukemic
activity of micheliolide, ultimately leading to the discovery of “micheliologs”
with improved potency against acute myelogenic leukemia cells. These
late-stage C–H functionalization routes could be further leveraged
to generate a panel of affinity probes for conducting a comprehensive
analysis of the protein targeting profile of micheliolide in leukemia
cells via chemical proteomics analyses. These studies introduce new
micheliolide-based antileukemic agents and shed new light onto the
biomolecular targets and mechanism of action of micheliolide in leukemia
cells. More broadly, this work showcases the value of the present
P450-mediated C–H functionalization strategy for streamlining
the late-stage diversification and elucidation of the biomolecular
targets of a complex bioactive molecule.",American Chemical Society,4/28/2021,2021,Hanan Alwaseem; Simone Giovani; Michele Crotti; Kevin Welle; Craig T.

Many post-lingually deaf adult CI users achieve good speech recognition in quiet; unfortunately, CI technology conveys a degraded representation of pitch and timbre, essential components of music. Not surprisingly, most CI users achieve significantly poorer perception and enjoyment of music compared with normal hearing listeners. Anecdotal evidence indicates that this impacts music engagement, particularly singing and playing instruments requiring ongoing tuning to external pitches or producing intervallic ratios. Interestingly, a small cohort of adult CI users has shown remarkable success in recovering or developing musical skills, but their success is poorly understood. Greater understanding of their efforts and attitudes may suggest potential rehabilitative approaches for other CI users.PurposeThis article documented personal characteristics and experiences perceived to contribute to high level musicianship. Research questions included: (1) What forms of practice/experience have most contributed to (re)establishing satisfying music making? (2) What situations or musical tasks are most frustrating or challenging? (3) What attitudes, motivational factors, or forms of support help CI users persist in working toward improved music engagement?MethodsQualitative and patient–engaged research methodologies were used. Our study involved a unique collaboration of six CI users engaged in high levels of musicianship and a researcher whose scholarship focuses on music and CIs. The CI recipients conveyed their experiences and attitudes regarding music and CIs through open-ended narratives. These narratives were analyzed using an integrative approach of inductive and deductive coding methods. The codes and themes that emerged through inductive methods were then organized within the Dynamic Problem Solving Model for Management of Music Listening Environments (Gfeller et al., 2019a).Outcomes:This paper provides reflections of six CI users who successfully engage in active music making, including on-going tuning to external pitches and ensemble participation. Their perspectives emphasize the importance of pre-CI music instruction, extensive practice and immersion in music listening and playing, persistence and self-efficacy, and problem solving skills that optimize music engagement, and suggest possible strategies useful to other CI users interested in improving music experiences.",Frontiers,12/24/2019,2019,Kate Gfeller; Ruth MacMullen Mallalieu; Aleksander Mansouri; Gaelen McCormick; Renee Blue O’Connell; Jake Spinowitz; Bettina Gellinek Turner,pub.1123608956,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/data_set/dataset.7604881,https://frontiersin.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_Sheet_1_Practices_and_Attitudes_That_Enhance_Music_Engagement_of_Adult_Cochlear_Implant_Users_PDF/11448945,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 36 Creative Arts and Writing; 36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3603 Music; 42 Health Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science,Assistive Technology; Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Mind and Body; Prevention; Rehabilitation,Ear; Mental health,,,,,,

Prostaglandin E2 and the EP4 receptor have been implicated in this process following tendon injury; thus, we hypothesized that inhibiting EP4 after tendon injury would attenuate adhesion formation. A model of flexor tendon laceration and repair was utilized in C57BL/6J female mice to evaluate the effects of EP4 inhibition on adhesion formation and matrix deposition during flexor tendon repair. Systemic EP4 antagonist or vehicle control was given by intraperitoneal injection during the late proliferative phase of healing, and outcomes were analyzed for range of motion, biomechanics, histology, and genetic changes. Repairs treated with an EP4 antagonist demonstrated significant decreases in range of motion with increased resistance to gliding within the first three weeks after injury, suggesting greater adhesion formation. Histologic analysis of the repair site revealed a more robust granulation zone in the EP4 antagonist treated repairs, with early polarization for type III collagen by picrosirius red staining, findings consistent with functional outcomes. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated accelerated peaks in F4/80 and type III collagen (Col3a1) expression in the antagonist group, along with decreases in type I collagen (Col1a1). Mmp9 expression was significantly increased after discontinuing the antagonist, consistent with its role in mediating adhesion formation. Mmp2, which contributes to repair site remodeling, increases steadily between 10 and 28 days post-repair in the EP4 antagonist group, consistent with the increased matrix and granulation zones requiring remodeling in these repairs. These findings suggest that systemic EP4 antagonism leads to increased adhesion formation and matrix deposition during flexor tendon healing. Counter to our hypothesis that EP4 antagonism would improve the healing phenotype, these results highlight the complex role of EP4 signaling during tendon repair.",Public Library of Science,8/27/2015,2015,Michael B.

Polarization Study of Its Reaction with Hydrogen","Reduction of Cp*2TaCl2 with sodium amalgam in THF under a nitrogen atmosphere results in the formation of the
novel complex (Cp*2TaCl)2(μ-N2). This dinuclear complex containing a μ-η1:η1 dinitrogen bridge has been
characterized by NMR and X-ray crystallography. The complex possesses a C2-symmetric structure with each Ta
bound to diastereotopic Cp* rings and chloride in addition to the μ-N2 bridge. The Ta−N and N−N distances of
1.885(10) and 1.23(1) Å, respectively, suggest modest reduction of the dinitrogen moiety. The two Cp* resonances
on each Ta center remain inequivalent in solution, even up to 80 °C. Addition of hydrogen results in the formation
of two isomers of the dihydride complex Cp*2TaH2Cl. Under parahydrogen, polarized resonances are observed for
the unsymmetrical isomer with adjacent hydrides as the product of H2 oxidative addition. The symmetric isomer of
Cp*2TaH2Cl also forms, most likely by isomerization of the unsymmetrical kinetic isomer. The reactivity of (Cp*2TaCl)2(μ-N2) was compared to that of the related monomer, Cp*2TaCl(THF). The THF adduct yields the same
hydrogen addition products, but the reaction is much more facile than for the nitrogen dimer, indicative of the
structural integrity of the μ-N2 complex.",American Chemical Society,7/19/2002,2002,Dawn C. Bregel; Susan M. Oldham; Rene J.

Base pairing in RNA is very favorable, but possibilities for RNA secondary structure of the influenza genomic RNA have not been investigated. This work presents the first experimentally-derived exploration of potential secondary structure in an influenza A naked (protein-free) genomic segment. Favorable folding regions are revealed by in vitro chemical structure mapping, thermodynamics, bioinformatics, and binding to isoenergetic microarrays of an entire natural sequence of the 875 nt segment 8 vRNA and of a smaller fragment. Segment 8 has thermodynamically stable and evolutionarily conserved RNA structure and encodes essential viral proteins NEP and NS1.

Conformational Flexibility of the Manganese(II)−(R<sub><i>n</i></sub>C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>7−<i>n</i></sub>) Bond,"Bis(cyclopentadienyl) complexes (Cp2M) of the divalent first-row transition metals V−Ni have been known and used for over 50 years. For almost as long, an analogous series of compounds has been known with the indenyl ligand (i.e., Ind2M), with the conspicuous exception of M = Mn. Bis(indenyl) complexes of manganese(II), Ind′2MnLn, have now been synthesized by halide metathesis from MnCl2 and an appropriate potassium indenide. Depending on the indenyl ligand substituents and the presence of coordinated bases, a variety of structural motifs and bonding modes of the indenyl ligand are found in the resulting complexes. Single-crystal X-ray structures obtained for [2-(SiMe3)C9H6]2Mn, [1,3-(SiMe3)2C9H5]2Mn, and [1,3-(i-Pr)2C9H5]2Mn confirm that they possess classic η5-bound sandwich structures. In contrast, the unsubstituted parent complex recrystallizes from THF as a disolvate with two differently bonded indenyl ligands: i.e., (η3-C9H7)(η1-C9H7)Mn(thf)2. Without the coordinated solvent, density functional theory calculations suggest that the complex would have two slipped η5-bound ligands. When methyl groups are present on the benzo portion of the indenyl ligand, specifically in the 4,7-positions, the corresponding manganese complex is isolated as a cyclic octomer, {(4,7-Me2C9H5)2Mn}8, containing both bridging and terminal indenyl ligands. In the presence of 1,4-dioxane, however, attempted synthesis of (4,7-Me2C9H5)2Mn results in the isolation of the [K(dioxane)1.5][Mn(4,7-Me2C9H5)3] salt, in which each manganese atom is surrounded by a paddlewheel of three η2-bound 4,7-dimethylindenyl ligands. Cation−π bonding to the potassium and the presence of coordinated dioxane molecules generates a layered structure for the salt. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on the compounds indicate the presence of high-spin Mn(II) centers in all cases. These compounds demonstrate the high degree of conformational flexibility in the Mn(II)−indenyl bond.",American Chemical Society,5/24/2010,2010,Jeffrey A. Crisp; Ryan M. Meier; Jason S.

few hydride complexes are known in which the metals have a
high-spin electronic configuration. We describe the characterization
of several high-spin iron­(II) hydride/deuteride isotopologues and
their exchange reactions with one another and with H2/D2. Though the hydride/deuteride signal is not observable in NMR spectra,
the choice of isotope has an influence on the chemical shifts of distant
protons in the dimers through the paramagnetic isotope effect on chemical
shift. This provides the first way to monitor the exchange of H and
D in the bridging positions of these hydride complexes. The rate of
exchange depends on the size of the supporting ligand, and this is
consistent with the idea that H2/D2 exchange
into the hydrides occurs through the dimeric complexes rather than
through a transient monomer. The understanding of H/D exchange mechanisms
in these high-spin iron hydride complexes may be relevant to postulated
nitrogenase mechanisms.",American Chemical Society,12/17/2015,2015,"Thomas

Its Derivatives via Photolysis of Pt Complexes:  Tuning the
C−C Bond Formation Energy toward Selective C−C Bond
Activation","Carbon−carbon bond activation of diphenylacetylene and several substituted derivatives has
been achieved via photolysis and studied. Pt0−acetylene complexes with η2-coordination of the alkyne,
along with the corresponding PtII C−C activated photolysis products, have been synthesized and
characterized, including X-ray crystal structural analysis. While the C−C cleavage reaction occurs readily
under photochemical conditions, thermal activation of the C−C bonds or formation of PtII complexes was
not observed. However, the reverse reaction, C−C reductive coupling (PtII → Pt0), did occur under thermal
conditions, allowing the determination of the energy barriers for C−C bond formation from the different PtII
complexes. For the reaction (dtbpe)Pt(−Ph)(−C⋮CPh) (2) → (dtbpe)Pt(η2-PhC⋮CPh) (1), ΔG⧧ was 32.03(3) kcal/mol. In comparison, the energy barrier for the C−C bond formation in an electron-deficient system,
that is, (dtbpe)Pt(C6F5)(C⋮CC6F5) (6) → (dtbpe)Pt(η2-bis(pentafluorophenyl)acetylene) (5), was found to
be 47.30 kcal/mol. The energy barrier for C−C bond formation was able to be tuned by electronically
modifying the substrate with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups. Upon cleavage of the C−C
bond in (dtbpe)Pt(η2-(p-fluorophenyl-p-tolylacetylene) (9), both (dtbpe)Pt(p-fluorophenyl)(p-tolylacetylide)
(10) and (dtbpe)Pt(p-tolyl)(p-fluorophenylacetylide) (11) were obtained. Kinetic studies of the reverse reaction
confirmed that 10 was more stable toward the reductive coupling [the term “reductive coupling” is defined
as the formation of (dtbpe)Pt(η2-acetylene) complex from the PtII complex] than 11 by 1.22 kcal/mol, under
the assumption that the transition-state energies are the same for the two pathways. The product ratio for
10 and 11 was 55:45, showing that the electron-deficient C−C bond is only slightly preferentially cleaved.",American Chemical Society,7/18/2007,2007,Ahmet Gunay; William D.

We evaluated the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of a multi-component smartphone-telemedicine program (TEAMS) to deliver asthma care remotely, support provider adherence to asthma management guidelines, and improve patient outcomes.  TEAMS utilized: (1) remote symptom monitoring, (2) nurse-led smartphone-telemedicine with self-management training for patients, and (3) Electronic medical record-based clinical decision support software. Adults aged 18-44 (N = 33) and primary care providers (N = 4) were recruited from a safety-net practice in Upstate New York. Asthma control, quality of life, and FEV1 were measured at 0, 3 and 6 months. Acceptability was assessed via survey and end-of-study interviews. Paired t-test and mixed effects modeling were used to evaluate the effect of the intervention on asthma outcomes.  At baseline, 80% of participants had uncontrolled asthma. By 6-months, 80% classified as well-controlled. Improvements in control and quality of life were large (d = 1.955, d = 1.579). FEV%pred increased 4.2% (d = 1.687) with the greatest gain in males, smokers, and lower educational status. Provider adherence to national guidelines increased from 43.3% to 86.7% (CI = 22.11-64.55) and patient adherence to medication increased from 45.58% to 85.29% (CI = 14.79-64.62). Acceptability was 95.7%; In follow up interviews, 29/30 patients and all providers indicated TEAMS worked better than usual care, supported effective self-management, and reduced symptoms over time, which led to greater self-efficacy and motivation to manage asthma.  Based on these findings, we conclude that smartphone telemedicine could substantially improve clinical asthma management, adherence to guidelines, and patient outcomes.",Taylor & Francis Group,10/16/2020,2020,Jennifer R.

Additionally, SQSTM1 shuttles between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, although its role in the nucleus is relatively unknown. Here, we report that SQSTM1 dynamically associates with DNA damage foci (DDF) and regulates DNA repair. Upon induction of DNA damage SQSTM1 interacts with FLNA (filamin A), which has previously been shown to recruit DNA repair protein RAD51 (RAD51 recombinase) to double-strand breaks and facilitate homologous recombination (HR). SQSTM1 promotes proteasomal degradation of FLNA and RAD51 within the nucleus, resulting in reduced levels of nuclear RAD51 and slower DNA repair. SQSTM1 regulates the ratio between HR and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) by promoting the latter at the expense of the former. This SQSTM1-dependent mechanism mediates the effect of macroautophagy on DNA repair. Moreover, nuclear localization of SQSTM1 and its association with DDF increase with aging and are prevented by life-span-extending dietary restriction, suggesting that an imbalance in the mechanism identified here may contribute to aging and age-related diseases.",Taylor & Francis Group,7/8/2016,2016,Graeme Hewitt; Bernadette Carroll; Rezazadeh Sarallah; Clara Correia-Melo; Mikołaj Ogrodnik; Glyn Nelson; Elsje G.

Guided Covalent Stapling and Structural Basis of Enhanced Stabilization","Enhancing the thermostability
of enzymes without impacting their
catalytic function represents an important yet challenging goal in
protein engineering and biocatalysis. We recently introduced a novel
method for enzyme thermostabilization that relies on the computationally
guided installation of genetically encoded thioether “staples”
into a protein via cysteine alkylation with the noncanonical amino
acid O-2-bromoethyl tyrosine (O2beY). Here, we demonstrate
the functionality of an expanded set of electrophilic amino acids
featuring chloroacetamido, acrylamido, and vinylsulfonamido side-chain
groups for protein stapling using this strategy. Using a myoglobin-based
cyclopropanase as a model enzyme, our studies show that covalent stapling
with p-chloroacetamido-phenylalanine (pCaaF) provides
higher stapling efficiency and enhanced stability (thermodynamic and
kinetic) compared to the other stapled variants and the parent protein.
Interestingly, molecular simulations of conformational flexibility
of the cross-links show that the pCaaF staple allows fewer energetically
feasible conformers than the other staples, and this property may
be a broader indicator of stability enhancement. Using this strategy,
pCaaF-stapled variants with significantly enhanced stability against
thermal denaturation (ΔTm′
= +27 °C) and temperature-induced heme loss (ΔT50 = +30 °C) were obtained while maintaining high
levels of catalytic activity and stereoselectivity. Crystallographic
analyses of singly and doubly stapled variants provide key insights
into the structural basis for stabilization, which includes both direct
interactions of the staples with protein residues and indirect interactions
through adjacent residues involved in heme binding. This work expands
the toolbox of protein stapling strategies available for protein stabilization.",American Chemical Society,5/25/2022,2022,"Jacob

R2 elements form stable long-term associations with their host, in which all individuals in a population contain many potentially active copies, but only a fraction of these individuals show active R2 retrotransposition. Previous studies have found that R2 RNA transcripts are processed from a 28S co-transcript and that the likelihood of R2-inserted units being transcribed is dependent upon their distribution within the rDNA locus. Here we analyze the rDNA locus and R2 elements from nearly 100 R2-active and R2-inactive individuals from natural populations of Drosophila simulans. Along with previous findings concerning the structure and expression of the rDNA loci, these data were incorporated into computer simulations to model the crossover events that give rise to the concerted evolution of the rRNA genes. The simulations that best reproduce the population data assume that only about 40 rDNA units out of the over 200 total units are actively transcribed and that these transcribed units are clustered in a single region of the locus. In the model, the host establishes this transcription domain at each generation in the region with the fewest R2 insertions. Only if the host cannot avoid R2 insertions within this 40-unit domain are R2 elements active in that generation. The simulations also require that most crossover events in the locus occur in the transcription domain in order to explain the empirical observation that R2 elements are seldom duplicated by crossover events. Thus the key to the long-term stability of R2 elements is the stochastic nature of the crossover events within the rDNA locus, and the inevitable expansions and contractions that introduce and remove R2-inserted units from the transcriptionally active domain.

Commonly used models of the human bone marrow microenvironment include murine models and two-dimensional and three-dimensional tissue cultures. While these model systems have led to critical advances in the field, they fail to recapitulate many aspects of the human bone marrow. This has limited our understanding of human bone marrow pathophysiology and has led to deficiencies in therapy for many bone marrow pathologies such as bone marrow failure syndromes and leukemias. Therefore, we have developed a modular murine bone marrow microenvironment-on-chip using a commercially available microfluidic platform. This model includes a vascular channel separated from the bone marrow channel by a semi-porous membrane and incorporates critical components of the bone marrow microenvironment, including osteoblasts, endothelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. This system is capable of maintaining functional hematopoietic stem cells in vitro for at least 14 days at frequencies similar to what is found in the primary bone marrow. The modular nature of this system and its accessibility will allow for acceleration of our understanding of the bone marrow.",Frontiers,6/20/2022,2022,Azmeer Sharipol; Maggie L. Lesch; Celia A.

Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 287(1-2), 175-184","Cretaceous lava flows overlie Jurassic to Early Cretaceous oceanic crust in the Nauru Basin of the western equatorial Pacific, but their exact age and origin is controversial. In one model, they are generically related to volcanism forming the Ontong Java Plateau. However, paleomagnetic data from basalts recovered by ocean drilling in the Nauru Basin have been interpreted as recording numerous geomagnetic reversals, suggesting the Nauru Basin basalts are older than the Early Aptian flows on the Ontong Java Plateau, and the correlative volcanism seen in the western equatorial and southwestern Pacific Ocean basin. Here, we examine the magnetic fidelity of the Nauru Basin basalts through rock magnetic and paleomagnetic approaches. We find the magnetic carriers in the lavas are unlike most basaltic units recovered by oceanic drilling in that they are magnetically soft. This quality makes the rocks especially prone to the acquisition of secondary magnetic components induced during drilling. We demonstrate that the reversed polarity intervals are illusory, and instead record subtle changes in magnetic hardness that result in partial and complete overprinting by the magnetic field associated with the drill string (e.g., the core barrel, drill pipe and bit). The recognition of these magnetic overprints, the identification of only normal polarity in the Nauru Basin basalts, and a critical consideration of the available radiometric and biostratigraphic age data lead us to conclude that coeval formation of the Nauru Basin basalts and Ontong Java Plateau in Aptian times remains a viable hypothesis.",PANGAEA,1/1/2009,2009,"Doubrovine, Pavel V; Tarduno, John A; Zhao, Xixi",pub.1053665317,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/data_set/dataset.5680210,https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.789122,37 Earth Sciences; 37 Earth Sciences; 3703 Geochemistry; 3705 Geology; 3706 Geophysics,,,,,,,,

However, all species are not equally at risk of infection, and risk is further modified by environmental variables, specifically temperature. In order to understand how, and when, hosts mount a response to Bd we analysed infection dynamics and patterns of gene expression in the model amphibian species Silurana (Xenopus) tropicalis. Mathematical modelling of infection dynamics demonstrate the existence of a temperature-dependent protective response that is largely independent of the intrinsic growth-rate of Bd. Using temporal expression-profiling by microarrays and qRT-PCR, we characterise this response in the main amphibian lymphoid tissue, the spleen. We demonstrate that clearance of Bd at the host-optimal temperature is not clearly associated with an adaptive immune response, but rather is correlated with the induction of components of host innate immunity including the expression of genes that are associated with the production of the antimicrobial skin peptide preprocareulein (PPCP) as well as inflammatory responses. We find that adaptive immunity appears to be lacking at host-optimal temperatures. This suggests that either Bd does not stimulate, or suppresses, adaptive immunity, or that trade-offs exist between innate and adaptive limbs of the amphibian immune system. At cold temperatures, S. tropicalis loses the ability to mount a PPCP-based innate response, and instead manifests a more pronounced inflammatory reaction that is characterised by the production of proteases and higher pathogen burdens. This study demonstrates the temperature-dependency of the amphibian response to infection by Bd and indicates the influence that changing climates may exert on the ectothermic host response to pathogens.",Public Library of Science,12/22/2009,2009,Laia Ribas; Ming-Shi Li; Benjamin J.

Transcripts from over 5000 predicted genes are expressed at levels >5× corrected background and 95 genes are expressed at >250× corrected background in all stages. Transcripts homologous to 91 predicted genes are specifically expressed and 155 more are highly up-regulated in growing cells, while 90 are specifically expressed and 616 are up-regulated during starvation. Strikingly, transcripts homologous to 1068 predicted genes are specifically expressed and 1753 are significantly up-regulated during conjugation. The patterns of gene expression during conjugation correlate well with the developmental stages of meiosis, nuclear differentiation and DNA elimination. The relationship between gene expression and chromosome fragmentation is analyzed. Genes encoding proteins known to interact or to function in complexes show similar expression patterns, indicating that co-ordinate expression with putative genes of known function can identify genes with related functions. New candidate genes associated with the RNAi-like process of DNA elimination and with meiosis are identified and the late stages of conjugation are shown to be characterized by specific expression of an unexpectedly large and diverse number of genes not involved in nuclear functions.",Public Library of Science,2/10/2009,2009,Wei Miao; Jie Xiong; Josephine Bowen; Wei Wang; Yifan Liu; Olga Braguinets; Jorg Grigull; Ronald E.

We built miRge to be a fast, smart small RNA-seq solution to process samples in a highly multiplexed fashion. miRge employs a Bayesian alignment approach, whereby reads are sequentially aligned against customized mature miRNA, hairpin miRNA, noncoding RNA and mRNA sequence libraries. miRNAs are summarized at the level of raw reads in addition to reads per million (RPM). Reads for all other RNA species (tRNA, rRNA, snoRNA, mRNA) are provided, which is useful for identifying potential contaminants and optimizing small RNA purification strategies. miRge was designed to optimally identify miRNA isomiRs and employs an entropy based statistical measurement to identify differential production of isomiRs. This allowed us to identify decreasing entropy in isomiRs as stem cells mature into retinal pigment epithelial cells. Conversely, we show that pancreatic tumor miRNAs have similar entropy to matched normal pancreatic tissues. In a head-to-head comparison with other miRNA analysis tools (miRExpress 2.0, sRNAbench, omiRAs, miRDeep2, Chimira, UEA small RNA Workbench), miRge was faster (4 to 32-fold) and was among the top-two methods in maximally aligning miRNAs reads per sample. Moreover, miRge has no inherent limits to its multiplexing. miRge was capable of simultaneously analyzing 100 small RNA-Seq samples in 52 minutes, providing an integrated analysis of miRNA expression across all samples. As miRge was designed for analysis of single as well as multiple samples, miRge is an ideal tool for high and low-throughput users. miRge is freely available at http://atlas.pathology.jhu.edu/baras/miRge.html.",Public Library of Science,11/16/2015,2015,Alexander S.

Its Derivatives via Photolysis of Pt Complexes:  Tuning the
C−C Bond Formation Energy toward Selective C−C Bond
Activation","Carbon−carbon bond activation of diphenylacetylene and several substituted derivatives has
been achieved via photolysis and studied. Pt0−acetylene complexes with η2-coordination of the alkyne,
along with the corresponding PtII C−C activated photolysis products, have been synthesized and
characterized, including X-ray crystal structural analysis. While the C−C cleavage reaction occurs readily
under photochemical conditions, thermal activation of the C−C bonds or formation of PtII complexes was
not observed. However, the reverse reaction, C−C reductive coupling (PtII → Pt0), did occur under thermal
conditions, allowing the determination of the energy barriers for C−C bond formation from the different PtII
complexes. For the reaction (dtbpe)Pt(−Ph)(−C⋮CPh) (2) → (dtbpe)Pt(η2-PhC⋮CPh) (1), ΔG⧧ was 32.03(3) kcal/mol. In comparison, the energy barrier for the C−C bond formation in an electron-deficient system,
that is, (dtbpe)Pt(C6F5)(C⋮CC6F5) (6) → (dtbpe)Pt(η2-bis(pentafluorophenyl)acetylene) (5), was found to
be 47.30 kcal/mol. The energy barrier for C−C bond formation was able to be tuned by electronically
modifying the substrate with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups. Upon cleavage of the C−C
bond in (dtbpe)Pt(η2-(p-fluorophenyl-p-tolylacetylene) (9), both (dtbpe)Pt(p-fluorophenyl)(p-tolylacetylide)
(10) and (dtbpe)Pt(p-tolyl)(p-fluorophenylacetylide) (11) were obtained. Kinetic studies of the reverse reaction
confirmed that 10 was more stable toward the reductive coupling [the term “reductive coupling” is defined
as the formation of (dtbpe)Pt(η2-acetylene) complex from the PtII complex] than 11 by 1.22 kcal/mol, under
the assumption that the transition-state energies are the same for the two pathways. The product ratio for
10 and 11 was 55:45, showing that the electron-deficient C−C bond is only slightly preferentially cleaved.",American Chemical Society,7/18/2007,2007,Ahmet Gunay; William D.

We have quantified chronological life span and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) in 11 natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that genomic instability increases and mitotic asymmetry breaks down during chronological aging. The age-dependent increase of genomic instability generally lags behind the drop of viability and this delay accounts for ∼50% of the observed natural variation of replicative life span in these yeast isolates. We conclude that the abilities of yeast strains to tolerate genomic instability co-vary with their replicative life spans. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative evidence that demonstrates a link between genomic instability and natural variation in life span.",Public Library of Science,7/16/2008,2008,Hong Qin; Meng Lu; David S.

C−C and C−H Bond Activation Reactions in the
Interconversion of Allyl Cyanide by [Ni(dippe)]","Reaction of [(dippe)Ni(μ-H)]2 with allyl cyanide at low temperature quantitatively generates the
η2-olefin complex (dippe)Ni(CH2CHCH2CN) (1). At ambient temperature or above, the olefin complex is
converted to a mixture of C−CN cleavage product (dippe)Ni(η3-allyl)(CN) (3) and the olefin-isomerization
products (dippe)Ni(η2-crotonitrile) (cis- and trans-2), which form via C−H activation. The latter are the
exclusive products at longer reaction times, indicating that C−CN cleavage is reversible and the crotononitrile
complexes 2 are more thermodynamically stable than η3-allyl species 3. The kinetics of this reaction have
been followed as a function of temperature, and rate constants have been extracted by modeling of the
reaction. The rate constants for C−CN bond formation (the reverse of C−CN cleavage) show a stronger
temperature dependence than those for C−CN and C−H activation, making the observed distribution of
C−H versus C−CN cleavage products strongly temperature-dependent. The activation parameters for the
C−CN formation step are also quite distinct from those of the C−CN and C−H cleavage steps (larger ΔH⧧
and positive ΔS⧧). Addition of the Lewis acid BPh3 to 1 at low temperature yields exclusively the C−CN
activation product (dippe)Ni(η3-allyl)(CNBPh3) (4). Independently prepared (dippe)Ni(crotononitrile-BPh3)
(cis- and trans-7) does not interconvert with 4, indicating that 4 is the kinetic product of the BPh3-mediated
reaction. On standing in solution at ambient temperature, 4 decomposes slowly to complex 5, with structure
[(dippe)Ni(η3-allyl)(N⋮C−BPh3), while addition of a second equivalent of BPh3 immediately produces [(dippe)Ni(η3-allyl)]+[Ph3BC⋮NBPh3]- (6). Comparison of the barriers to π−σ allyl interconversion (determined via
dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopy) for all of the η3-allyl complexes reveals that axial cyanide ligands facilitate
π−σ interconversion by moving into the P2Ni square plane when the allyl group is σ-bound.",American Chemical Society,3/24/2004,2004,Nicole M. Brunkan; Donna M. Brestensky; William D.

In a previous report, ERBB2 activation in a subset of cochlear SCs promoted widespread down-regulation of SOX2 in neighboring cells, proliferation, and the differentiation of HC-like cells. Here we analyze single cell transcriptomes from neonatal mouse cochlear SCs with activated ERBB2, with the goal of identifying potential secreted effectors. ERBB2 induction in vivo generated a new population of cells with de novo expression of a gene network. Called small integrin-binding ligand n-linked glycoproteins (SIBLINGs), these ligands and their regulators can alter NOTCH signaling and promote cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation in other systems. We validated mRNA expression of network members, and then extended our analysis to older stages. ERBB2 signaling in young adult SCs also promoted protein expression of gene network members. Furthermore, we found proliferating cochlear cell aggregates in the organ of Corti. Our results suggest that ectopic activation of ERBB2 signaling in cochlear SCs can alter the microenvironment, promoting proliferation and cell rearrangements. Together these results suggest a novel mechanism for inducing stem cell-like activity in the adult mammalian cochlea.",Frontiers,1/6/2023,2023,Dorota Piekna-Przybylska; Daxiang Na; Jingyuan Zhang; Cameron Baker; John M.

Dehydrogenative C–C Coupling by a
Pincer-Ligated Iridium Complex","The
pincer-iridium fragment (iPrPCP)Ir (RPCP = κ3-2,6-C6H3­(CH2PR2)2) has been found to catalyze the
dehydrogenative coupling of vinyl arenes to afford predominantly (E,E)-1,4-diaryl-1,3-butadienes. The eliminated
hydrogen can undergo addition to another molecule of vinyl arene,
resulting in an overall disproportionation reaction with 1 equiv of
ethyl arene formed for each equivalent of diaryl­butadiene produced.
Alternatively, sacrificial hydrogen acceptors (e.g., tert-butyl­ethylene) can be added to the solution for this purpose.
Diaryl­butadienes are isolated in moderate to good yields, up
to ca. 90% based on the disproportionation reaction. The results of
DFT calculations and experiments with substituted styrenes indicate
that the coupling proceeds via double C–H addition of a styrene
molecule, at β-vinyl and ortho-aryl positions,
to give an iridium­(III) metallo­indene intermediate; this intermediate
then adds a β-vinyl C–H bond of a second styrene molecule
before reductively eliminating product. Several metallo­indene
complexes have been isolated and crystallographically characterized.
In accord with the proposed mechanism, substitution at the ortho-aryl positions of the styrene precludes dehydrogenative
homocoupling. In the case of 2,4,6-trimethyl­styrene, dehydrogenative
coupling of β-vinyl and ortho-methyl C–H
bonds affords dimethyl­indene, demonstrating that the dehydrogenative
coupling is not limited to C­(sp2)–H bonds.",American Chemical Society,6/8/2017,2017,Miles Wilklow-Marnell; Bo Li; Tian Zhou; Karsten Krogh-Jespersen; William W. Brennessel; Thomas J. Emge; Alan S.

Conjugated Covalent Organic Networks via Zincke Reaction","Morphology
influences the functionality of covalent organic networks and determines
potential applications. Here, we report for the first time the use
of Zincke reaction to fabricate, under either solvothermal or microwave
conditions, a viologen-linked covalent organic network in the form
of hollow particles or nanosheets. The synthesized materials are stable
in acidic, neutral, and basic aqueous solutions. Under basic conditions,
the neutral network assumes radical cationic character without decomposing
or changing structure. Solvent polarity and heating method determine
product morphology. Depending upon solvent polarity, the resulting
polymeric network forms either uniform self-templated hollow spheres
(HS) or hollow tubes (HT). The spheres develop
via an inside-out Ostwald ripening mechanism. Interestingly, microwave
conditions and certain solvent polarities result in the formation
of a robust covalent organic gel framework (COGF) that
is organized in nanosheets stacked several layers thick. In the gel
phase, the nanosheets are crystalline and form honeycomb lattices.
The use of the Zincke reaction has previously been limited to the
synthesis of small viologen molecules and conjugated viologen oligomers.
Its application here expands the repertoire of tools for the fabrication
of covalent organic networks (which are usually prepared by dynamic
covalent chemistry) and for the synthesis of viologen-based materials.
All three materialsHT, HS, and COGFserve as efficient adsorbents of iodine due to

C−C and C−H Bond Activation Reactions in the
Interconversion of Allyl Cyanide by [Ni(dippe)]","Reaction of [(dippe)Ni(μ-H)]2 with allyl cyanide at low temperature quantitatively generates the
η2-olefin complex (dippe)Ni(CH2CHCH2CN) (1). At ambient temperature or above, the olefin complex is
converted to a mixture of C−CN cleavage product (dippe)Ni(η3-allyl)(CN) (3) and the olefin-isomerization
products (dippe)Ni(η2-crotonitrile) (cis- and trans-2), which form via C−H activation. The latter are the
exclusive products at longer reaction times, indicating that C−CN cleavage is reversible and the crotononitrile
complexes 2 are more thermodynamically stable than η3-allyl species 3. The kinetics of this reaction have
been followed as a function of temperature, and rate constants have been extracted by modeling of the
reaction. The rate constants for C−CN bond formation (the reverse of C−CN cleavage) show a stronger
temperature dependence than those for C−CN and C−H activation, making the observed distribution of
C−H versus C−CN cleavage products strongly temperature-dependent. The activation parameters for the
C−CN formation step are also quite distinct from those of the C−CN and C−H cleavage steps (larger ΔH⧧
and positive ΔS⧧). Addition of the Lewis acid BPh3 to 1 at low temperature yields exclusively the C−CN
activation product (dippe)Ni(η3-allyl)(CNBPh3) (4). Independently prepared (dippe)Ni(crotononitrile-BPh3)
(cis- and trans-7) does not interconvert with 4, indicating that 4 is the kinetic product of the BPh3-mediated
reaction. On standing in solution at ambient temperature, 4 decomposes slowly to complex 5, with structure
[(dippe)Ni(η3-allyl)(N⋮C−BPh3), while addition of a second equivalent of BPh3 immediately produces [(dippe)Ni(η3-allyl)]+[Ph3BC⋮NBPh3]- (6). Comparison of the barriers to π−σ allyl interconversion (determined via
dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopy) for all of the η3-allyl complexes reveals that axial cyanide ligands facilitate
π−σ interconversion by moving into the P2Ni square plane when the allyl group is σ-bound.",American Chemical Society,3/24/2004,2004,Nicole M. Brunkan; Donna M. Brestensky; William D.

Compounds by Hydrogen Bonding or Metal Ion Coordination","The mononuclear Au(I) complex, Au(Spy)(PPh2py) (1), has been synthesized and characterized structurally. The
complex possesses the expected linear coordination geometry with a S−Au−P bond angle of 176.03(6)° and no
evidence of aurophilic interactions between nearest neighbor Au(I) ions in the solid state. Protonation of the
pendant pyridyl groups of 1 leads to the formation of the H-bonded dimer [{Au(SpyH)(PPh2py)}2](PF6)2 (2),
which has also been structurally characterized. A linear coordination geometry at the Au(I) ions in 2 with a
S−Au−P bond angle of 173.7(2)° is augmented by evidence of a strong aurophilic interaction with a Au···Au
distance of 2.979(1) Å. The pendant pyridyl groups of 1 have also been used to bind Cu(I) by reactions with
[Cu(NCMe)4](PF6) and Cu(P(p-tolyl)3)2(NO3) leading to the formation of the heterobimetallic complexes [{AuCu(μ-Spy)(μ-PPh2py)}2](PF6)2 (3) and [AuCu(P(p-tolyl)3)2(μ-Spy)(μ-PPh2py)](NO3) (4), respectively. A structure
determination of 3 reveals a tetranuclear complex composed of two AuCu(μ-Spy)(μ-PPh2py)+ units held together
by bridging thiolate ligands. A strong metal−metal interaction is noted between the two different d10 ions with
nearest Au−Cu distances averaging 2.6395 Å. The S−Au−P bond angles in 3 deviate slightly from linearity due
to the Au···Cu interactions, while the coordination geometries at Cu(I) are distorted tetrahedral consisting of the
two pyridyl nitrogen atoms, a bridging thiolate sulfur, and the interacting Au(I) ion. While mononuclear complex
1 is only weakly emissive in the solid state and in fluid solution, complexes 2−4 show stronger photoluminescence
in the solid state and rigid media at 77 K, and in fluid solution. The emission maxima for 2−4 in ambient
temperature fluid solution are 470, 635, and 510 nm, respectively. A tentative assignment of the emitting state as
a S(pπ) → Au LMCT transition is made on the basis of previous studies of Au(I) thiolate phosphine complexes.
Shifts of λem result from the influence of H bonding or Cu(I) coordination on the filled thiolate orbital energy, or
on the effect of metal−metal interaction on the Au(I) acceptor orbital energy. Crystal data for Au(Spy)(PPh2py)

and Ni­(4,4′-Z-2,2′-bpy)­(pyS)2 (Z = H (4a), CH3 (4b), OCH3 (4c); bpy = bipyridine) have been synthesized in high yield
and characterized. X-ray diffraction studies show that 2 is square planar, while the other complexes possess tris-chelated
distorted-octahedral geometries. All of the complexes are active catalysts
for both the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic production of hydrogen
in 1/1 EtOH/H2O. When coupled with fluorescein (Fl) as
the photosensitizer (PS) and triethylamine (TEA) as the sacrificial
electron donor, these complexes exhibit activity for light-driven
hydrogen generation that correlates with ligand electron donor ability.
Complex 4c achieves over 7300 turnovers of H2 in 30 h, which is among the highest reported for a molecular noble
metal-free system. The initial photochemical step is reductive quenching
of Fl* by TEA because of the latter’s greater concentration.
When system concentrations are modified so that oxidative quenching
of Fl* by catalyst becomes more dominant, system durability increases,
with a system lifetime of over 60 h. System variations and cyclic
voltammetry experiments are consistent with a CECE mechanism that
is common to electrocatalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen production.
This mechanism involves initial protonation of the catalyst followed
by reduction and then additional protonation and reduction steps to
give a key Ni–H–/N–H+ intermediate
that forms the H–H bond in the turnover-limiting step of the
catalytic cycle. A key to the activity of these catalysts is the reversible
dechelation and protonation of the pyridine N atoms, which enable
an internal heterocoupling of a metal hydride and an N-bound proton
to produce H2.",American Chemical Society,10/2/2013,2013,Zhiji Han; Luxi Shen; William W. Brennessel; Patrick L.

Inflammatory conditions exhibit elevated blood microparticle numbers compared to healthy conditions. Direct functional consequences of microparticle composition, especially internal composition, on recipient cells are poorly understood. Our objective was to evaluate if microparticle composition could impact the function of recipient cells, particularly during inflammatory provocation. We therefore engineered the composition of megakaryocyte culture-derived microparticles to generate distinct microparticle populations that were given to human monocytes to assay for influences recipient cell function. Herein, we tested the responses of monocytes exposed to either control microparticles or microparticles that contain the anti-inflammatory transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). In order to normalize relative microparticle abundance from two microparticle populations, we implemented a novel approach that utilizes a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer to assay for microparticle density rather than concentration. We found that when given to peripheral blood mononuclear cells, microparticles were preferentially internalized by CD11b+ cells, and furthermore, microparticle composition had a profound functional impact on recipient monocytes. Specifically, microparticles containing PPARγ reduced activated monocyte production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 compared to activated monocytes exposed to control microparticles. Additionally, treatment with PPARγ microparticles greatly increased monocyte cell adherence. This change in morphology occurred simultaneously with increased production of the key extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin and increased expression of the fibronectin-binding integrin, ITGA5. PPARγ microparticles also changed monocyte mRNA levels of several genes including those under PPARγ control. Overall, the delivery of PPARγ from microparticles to human monocytes influenced gene expression, decreased inflammatory mediator production and increased monocyte adherence. These results support the concept that the composition of blood microparticles has a profound impact on the function of cells with which they interact, and likely plays a role in vascular inflammation.",Public Library of Science,11/26/2014,2014,Julie Sahler; Collynn F.

Of these biomaterials, tooth enamel is the hardest, most mineralized vertebrate tissue and therefore least likely to be affected by chemical alteration (i.e., its isotopic composition can be preserved over millions of years), making it an important and widely available archive for biologists and paleontologists. Here, we present the first combined measurements of δ13C, δ15N, and δ18O in enamel from the teeth of modern fauna (herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores) from the well-studied ecosystem of Gorongosa National Park (GNP) in central Mozambique. We use two novel methods to produce high-precision stable isotope enamel data: (i) the “oxidation-denitrification method,” which permits the measurement of mineral-bound organic nitrogen in tooth enamel (δ15Nenamel), which until now, has not been possible due to enamel’s low organic content, and (ii) the “cold trap method,” which greatly reduces the sample size required for traditional measurements of inorganic δ13Cenamel and δ18Oenamel (from ≥0.5 to ≤0.1 mg), permitting analysis of small or valuable teeth and high-resolution serial sampling of enamel. The stable isotope results for GNP fauna reveal important ecological information about the trophic level, dietary niche, and resource consumption. δ15Nenamel values clearly differentiate trophic level (i.e., carnivore δ15Nenamel values are 4.0‰ higher, on average, than herbivores), δ13Cenamel values distinguish C3 and/or C4 biomass consumption, and δ18Oenamel values reflect local meteoric water (δ18Owater) in the park. Analysis of combined carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen stable isotope data permits geochemical separation of grazers, browsers, omnivores, and carnivores according to their isotopic niche, while mixed-feeding herbivores cannot be clearly distinguished from other dietary groups. These results confirm that combined C, N, and O isotope analyses of a single aliquot of tooth enamel can be used to reconstruct diet and trophic niches. Given its resistance to chemical alteration, the analysis of these three isotopes in tooth enamel has a high potential to open new avenues of research in (paleo)ecology and paleontology.",Frontiers,11/25/2022,2022,Tina Lüdecke; Jennifer N.

An underlying cause could be an age-related decline in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Successful aging of mitochondria reflects a balanced turnover of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy. Thus, an imbalance in mitochondrial turnover can contribute to the diminution of cellular function seen during aging. Mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy are mediated by a set of proteins including MFN1, MFN2, OPA1, DRP1, FIS1 as well as DMN1l and DNM1, all of which are required for mitochondrial fission. Using N15 labeling, we report that the turnover rates for DMN1l and FIS1 go in opposite directions in the cerebellum of 22-month-old C57BL6j mice as compared to 3-month-old mice. Previous studies have reported decreased turnover rates for the mitochondrial respiratory complexes of aged rodents. In contrast, we found increased turnover rates for mitochondrial proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation chain in the aged mice as compared to young mice. Furthermore, the turnover rate of the components that are most affected by aging –complex III components (ubiquinol cytochrome C oxidoreductase) and complex IV components (cytochrome C oxidase)– was significantly increased in the senescent cerebellum. However, the turnover rates of proteins involved in mitophagy (i.e., the proteasomal and lysosomal degradation of damaged mitochondria) were not significantly altered with age. Overall, our results suggest that an age-related imbalance in the turnover rates of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy (DMN1l, FIS1) in conjunction with an age-related imbalance in the turnover rates of proteins of the complexes III and IV of the electron transfer chain, might impair cerebellar mitochondrial bioenergetics in old mice.",Frontiers,2/16/2018,2018,Aurel Popa-Wagner; Raluca E.

Solution magnetization measurements are consistent with a paramagnetic Ni(I) system likely undergoing a monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium. The room-temperature and 4 K solid-state X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra display anisotropic signals. Low-temperature solid-state X-band EPR data at 4 K reveal rhombic values gz = 1.980(4), gx = 2. 380(4), and gy = 2.225(4), as well as a forbidden signal at g = 4.24 for the ΔMS = 2 half field transition, in accord with 2 having two weakly interacting metal centers. Utilizing an S = 1 model, full spin Hamiltonian simulation of the low-temperature EPR spectrum on the solid sample was achieved by applying a nonzero zero-field-splitting parameter (D = 0.001 cm−1), which is consistent with an S = 0 ground state with a very closely lying S = 1 state. Solid-state magnetization data also corroborate well with our solid-state EPR data and reveal weak antiferromagnetic behavior (J = −1.52(5) cm−1) over a 2−300 K temperature range at a field of 1 Tesla. Evidence for 2 being a masked “(PNP)Ni” scaffold originates from its reaction with N2CPh2, which traps the Ni(I) monomer in the form of a T-shaped species, Ni(PNPNNCPh2), a system that has been structurally characterized. The radical nature of complex 2, or its monomer component, is well manifested through the plethora of cooperative H−X-type bond cleavage reactions, providing the nickel(II) hydride (PNP)NiH and the corresponding rare functionalities −OH, −OCH3, −PHPh, and −B(catechol) integrated into the (PNP)Ni moiety in equal molar amounts.

Dithiolate Complexes","Two series of Pt(diimine)(dithiolate)
complexes have been prepared in order to investigate the effects
of
molecular design on the excited-state properties of this chromophore.
The first series comprises
Pt(dbbpy)(dithiolate)
complexes where dbbpy = 4,4‘-di-tert-butyl-2,2‘-bipyridine
and the dithiolates are 1-(tert-butylcarboxy)-1-cyanoethylene-2,2-dithiolate (tbcda),
1-diethylphosphonate-1-cyanoethylene-2,2-dithiolate (cpdt),
6,7-dimethyl-quinoxaline-2,3-dithiolate (dmqdt), maleonitriledithiolate (mnt), and
toluene-3,4-dithiolate (tdt). The second series
comprises Pt(diimine)(tdt) complexes where the diimines are
3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (tmphen),
4,4‘-di-tert-butyl-2,2‘-bipyridine (dbbpy),
4,4‘-dimethyl-2,2‘-bipyridine (dmbpy), 2,2‘-bipyridine (bpy),
1,10-phenanthroline
(phen), 5-chloro-1,10-phenanthroline (Cl-phen),
4,4‘-dichloro-2,2‘-bipyridine (Cl2bpy), and
4,4‘-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)-2,2‘-bipyridine (EC-bpy). All of the compounds display
solvatochromic absorption bands and solution luminescence,
which are attributed to a common charge-transfer-to-diimine excited
state. The excited-state energies can be tuned
by approximately 1 eV through ligand variation. Solution lifetimes
range from 1 ns to over 1000 ns and Φem
range
from 6.4 × 10-3 to less than 10-5 in
CH2Cl2. Based on these data, the
nonradiative and radiative decay rate constants
have been calculated. For the Pt(diimine)(tdt) series,
the nonradiative decay rate constants increase
exponentially
with decreasing energy, in agreement with the Energy Gap Law, while
those for the Pt(dbbpy)(dithiolate) complexes
do not exhibit a similar correlation. Excited-state redox
potentials have been estimated for all of the complexes
from spectroscopic and electrochemical data. The ability to tune
the driving force for bimolecular excited-state
electron-transfer reactions has been demonstrated for eight of the
complexes using reductive and oxidative quenching
experiments.",American Chemical Society,2/28/1996,1996,Scott D.

Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity","The synthesis, structure, and reactivity of a series of low-coordinate Fe(II) diketiminate amido complexes are presented.
Complexes LRFeNHAr (R = methyl, tert-butyl; Ar = para-tolyl, 2,6-xylyl, and 2,6-diisopropylphenyl) bind Lewis
bases to give trigonal pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal adducts. In the adducts, crystallographic and 1H NMR
evidence supports the existence of agostic interactions in solid and solution states. Complexes LRFeNHAr may be
oxidized using AgOTf, and the products LRFe(NHAr)(OTf) are characterized with 19F NMR spectroscopy, UV/vis
spectrophotometry, solution magnetic measurements, elemental analysis, and, in one case, X-ray crystallography.
In the structures of the iron(III) complexes LRFe(NHAr)(OTf) and LRFe(OtBu)(OTf), the angles at nitrogen and
oxygen result from steric effects and not π-bonding. The reactions of the amido group of LRFeNHAr with weak
acids (HCCPh and HOtBu) are consistent with a basic nitrogen atom, because the amido group is protonated by
terminal alkynes and alcohols to give free H2NAr and three-coordinate acetylide and alkoxide complexes. The
trends in complex stability give insight into the relative strength of bonds from three-coordinate iron to anionic C-,
N-, and O-donor ligands.",American Chemical Society,5/17/2004,2004,Nathan A. Eckert; Jeremy M. Smith; Rene J. Lachicotte; Patrick L.

An underlying cause could be an age-related decline in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Successful aging of mitochondria reflects a balanced turnover of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy. Thus, an imbalance in mitochondrial turnover can contribute to the diminution of cellular function seen during aging. Mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy are mediated by a set of proteins including MFN1, MFN2, OPA1, DRP1, FIS1 as well as DMN1l and DNM1, all of which are required for mitochondrial fission. Using N15 labeling, we report that the turnover rates for DMN1l and FIS1 go in opposite directions in the cerebellum of 22-month-old C57BL6j mice as compared to 3-month-old mice. Previous studies have reported decreased turnover rates for the mitochondrial respiratory complexes of aged rodents. In contrast, we found increased turnover rates for mitochondrial proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation chain in the aged mice as compared to young mice. Furthermore, the turnover rate of the components that are most affected by aging –complex III components (ubiquinol cytochrome C oxidoreductase) and complex IV components (cytochrome C oxidase)– was significantly increased in the senescent cerebellum. However, the turnover rates of proteins involved in mitophagy (i.e., the proteasomal and lysosomal degradation of damaged mitochondria) were not significantly altered with age. Overall, our results suggest that an age-related imbalance in the turnover rates of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy (DMN1l, FIS1) in conjunction with an age-related imbalance in the turnover rates of proteins of the complexes III and IV of the electron transfer chain, might impair cerebellar mitochondrial bioenergetics in old mice.",Frontiers,2/16/2018,2018,Aurel Popa-Wagner; Raluca E.

a new bidentate ligand, a second equivalent of sPhIO, acting as a
neutral, two-electron donor ligand, coordinated to the rhodium center
through the iodosyl oxygen. Over time, the sPhIO ligand dissociates
and dimerization occurs to generate a phenoxide-bridged dinuclear

when rhodium complex 1 was treated with excess phpy (14

Ecotoxicology and Evolutionary Toxicology","Hyalella azteca is a cryptic species complex of
epibenthic amphipods of interest to ecotoxicology and evolutionary
biology. It is the primary crustacean used in North America for sediment
toxicity testing and an emerging model for molecular ecotoxicology.
To provide molecular resources for sediment quality assessments and
evolutionary studies, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the genome
of the H. azteca U.S. Lab Strain. The genome quality
and completeness is comparable with other ecotoxicological model species.
Through targeted investigation and use of gene expression data sets
of H. azteca exposed to pesticides, metals, and other
emerging contaminants, we annotated and characterized the major gene
families involved in sequestration, detoxification, oxidative stress,
and toxicant response. Our results revealed gene loss related to light
sensing, but a large expansion in chemoreceptors, likely underlying
sensory shifts necessary in their low light habitats. Gene family
expansions were also noted for cytochrome P450 genes, cuticle proteins,
ion transporters, and include recent gene duplications in the metal
sequestration protein, metallothionein. Mapping of differentially
expressed transcripts to the genome significantly increased the ability
to functionally annotate toxicant responsive genes. The H.
azteca genome will greatly facilitate development of genomic
tools for environmental assessments and promote an understanding of
how evolution shapes toxicological pathways with implications for
environmental and human health.",American Chemical Society,5/15/2018,2018,Helen C. Poynton; Simone Hasenbein; Joshua B. Benoit; Maria S. Sepulveda; Monica F. Poelchau; Daniel S. T. Hughes; Shwetha C.

4370,4370,100,dataset.7744326,10.1371/journal.ppat.1007569,The Human Cytomegalovirus U<sub>L</sub>38 protein drives mTOR-independent metabolic flux reprogramming by inhibiting TSC2,"Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection induces several metabolic activities that are essential for viral replication. Despite the important role that this metabolic modulation plays during infection, the viral mechanisms involved are largely unclear. We find that the HCMV UL38 protein is responsible for many aspects of HCMV-mediated metabolic activation, with UL38 being necessary and sufficient to drive glycolytic activation and induce the catabolism of specific amino acids. UL38’s metabolic reprogramming role is dependent on its interaction with TSC2, a tumor suppressor that inhibits mTOR signaling. Further, shRNA-mediated knockdown of TSC2 recapitulates the metabolic phenotypes associated with UL38 expression. Notably, we find that in many cases the metabolic flux activation associated with UL38 expression is largely independent of mTOR activity, as broad spectrum mTOR inhibition does not impact UL38-mediated induction of glycolysis, glutamine consumption, or the secretion of proline or alanine. In contrast, the induction of metabolite concentrations observed with UL38 expression are largely dependent on active mTOR. Collectively, our results indicate that the HCMV UL38 protein induces a pro-viral metabolic environment via inhibition of TSC2.",Public Library of Science,1/24/2019,2019,Irene Rodríguez-Sánchez; Xenia L.

Annotated gene near-exon spans are scored per base for average expression scores from the data sets, and relative expression plotted with respect to gene transcript start (first exon), stop (last exon), and inner exon start, stop positions. Both methods (genome tiling and RNA-Seq) have abrupt expression strength changes at exon boundaries, on average, indicating their value in modeling gene structure positions. Expression scores are read-coverage for RNA-Seq, and log-normalized intensity for tiling array, as described in the Methods section. Figure S2. Gene modeling example with tile expression data, including gene evidence (upper tracks with tiling, introns, proteins), tiling TAR-exon to Exonerate models (middle), and gene predictions from tile TAR hints (lower), on genome map. The lower tracks have excessive false UTR spans attached to gene models, primarily due to tiling expression that lacks gene start/stop and intron splice joining signals. These false UTR spans are supported by expression evidence, but as a combination of alternate exons, separate gene loci, and non-coding expression. Intermediate tracks (Exonerate models) often match gene structures from other methods, but have a high proportion of unsupported exon extensions as for lower track. Figure S3. Gene join error example. A mistaken gene model from honey bee (tan, lower, LOC552483) is transferred to Nasonia in NCBI RefSeq models (dark orange, middle), merging a ribosomal protein (right) and Ankyrin repeat protein (left). EvidentialGene models (yellow, top) did not contain this mistake, due to the combination of RNA-Seq assemblies (purple, bottom) that are un-joined (but could be parts of one gene), the lack of intron joining evidence, and the orthology assessment metrics that distinguish gene joins from true complete genes. NCBI Refseq models for both Apis (new LOC102654426 and mRpL52 in NCBI Apis rel. 102) and Nasonia have been updated to correct this join error. Figure S4. Log counts of methylated and unmethylated genes in different classes of expression support. Grey bars indicate genes with no known methylation status.

The regioselectivity was investigated using a series of meta-substituted phenyl imines (−OMe, −CH3, −F, −COOMe, −CF3, and −CN) and 2-phenylpyridines (−OMe, −CH3, and −CF3). It was found that substrates with electron-donating substituents react significantly faster than substrates with electron-withdrawing substituents, which is consistent with an electrophilic C−H activation mechanism. It was also found that the regioselectivity of the C−H activation was extremely sensitive to steric effects, with a meta methyl group leading to only one regioisomer. Solvent and temperature studies showed that the reaction rate can be increased both by increasing temperature and by using polar solvents such as methanol. The regioselectivity was solvent dependent for the reaction with [Cp*IrCl2]2 but independent of solvent for the reaction with [Cp*RhCl2]2. The regioselectivity was temperature independent for both metals. With added acid, the aromatic C−H activation was shown to be reversible. Kinetic studies were performed, leading to the conclusion that [Cp*M(OAc)]+ is the key catalytic species responsible for the electrophilic C−H activation.",American Chemical Society,6/22/2009,2009,Ling Li; William W.

Our estimation exploits the relative expenditure of high- and low-income households on luxuries versus necessities. This double differencing corrects for measurement error that can vary over time by good and income.

Its Derivatives via Photolysis of Pt Complexes:  Tuning the
C−C Bond Formation Energy toward Selective C−C Bond
Activation","Carbon−carbon bond activation of diphenylacetylene and several substituted derivatives has
been achieved via photolysis and studied. Pt0−acetylene complexes with η2-coordination of the alkyne,
along with the corresponding PtII C−C activated photolysis products, have been synthesized and
characterized, including X-ray crystal structural analysis. While the C−C cleavage reaction occurs readily
under photochemical conditions, thermal activation of the C−C bonds or formation of PtII complexes was
not observed. However, the reverse reaction, C−C reductive coupling (PtII → Pt0), did occur under thermal
conditions, allowing the determination of the energy barriers for C−C bond formation from the different PtII
complexes. For the reaction (dtbpe)Pt(−Ph)(−C⋮CPh) (2) → (dtbpe)Pt(η2-PhC⋮CPh) (1), ΔG⧧ was 32.03(3) kcal/mol. In comparison, the energy barrier for the C−C bond formation in an electron-deficient system,
that is, (dtbpe)Pt(C6F5)(C⋮CC6F5) (6) → (dtbpe)Pt(η2-bis(pentafluorophenyl)acetylene) (5), was found to
be 47.30 kcal/mol. The energy barrier for C−C bond formation was able to be tuned by electronically
modifying the substrate with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups. Upon cleavage of the C−C
bond in (dtbpe)Pt(η2-(p-fluorophenyl-p-tolylacetylene) (9), both (dtbpe)Pt(p-fluorophenyl)(p-tolylacetylide)
(10) and (dtbpe)Pt(p-tolyl)(p-fluorophenylacetylide) (11) were obtained. Kinetic studies of the reverse reaction
confirmed that 10 was more stable toward the reductive coupling [the term “reductive coupling” is defined
as the formation of (dtbpe)Pt(η2-acetylene) complex from the PtII complex] than 11 by 1.22 kcal/mol, under
the assumption that the transition-state energies are the same for the two pathways. The product ratio for
10 and 11 was 55:45, showing that the electron-deficient C−C bond is only slightly preferentially cleaved.",American Chemical Society,7/18/2007,2007,Ahmet Gunay; William D.

Planarization in Donor–Bridge
Dye Sensitizers: Phenylene versus Thiophene Bridges","Donor−π–acceptor
complexes for solar energy
conversion are commonly composed of a chomophore donor and a semiconductor
nanoparticle acceptor separated by a π bridge. The electronic
coupling between the donor and acceptor is known to be large when
the π systems of the donor and bridge are coplanar. However,
the accessibility of highly coplanar geometries in the excited state
is not well understood. In this work, we clarify the relationship
between the bridge structure and excited-state donor–bridge
coplanarization by comparing rhodamine sensitizers with either phenylene
(O-Ph) or thiophene (O-Th) bridge units.
Using a variety of optical spectroscopic and computational techniques,
we model the S1 excited-state potential surfaces of O-Ph and O-Th along the dihedral coordinate of
donor–bridge coplanarization, τ. We find that O-Th accesses a nearly coplanar (τ = 8°) global minimum geometry
in S1 where significant intramolecular charge transfer
(ICT) character is developed. The S1 coplanar geometry
is populated in <10 ps and is stable for ca. 1 ns. Importantly, O-Ph is sterically hindered from rotation along τ and
therefore remains at its initial S1 equilibrium geometry
far from coplanarity (τ = 56°). Our results demonstrate
that donor–bridge dye sensitizers utilizing thiophene bridges
should facilitate strong donor–acceptor coupling by an ultrafast
and stabilizing coplanarization mechanism in S1. The coplanarization
will result in strong donor–acceptor coupling, potentially
increasing the electron transfer efficiency. These findings provide
further explanation for the success of thiophene as a bridge unit
and can be used to guide the informed design of new molecular sensitizers.",American Chemical Society,8/9/2018,2018,Zachary Piontkowski; David W.

Complex Based on the 1-Terpyridyl-2,3,4,5,6-pentaphenylbenzene
(TPPPB) Ligand","A novel terpyridine ligand containing a pentaphenylphenyl moiety linked to the terpyridyl core (1-terpyridyl-2,3,4,5,6-pentaphenyl-benzene (TPPPB)) has been synthesized in good yield and reacted with Pt(DMSO)2Cl2, to produce
the cationic complex [Pt(TPPPB)Cl]Cl (5). 5 was studied structurally and spectroscopically. It is observed to be
brightly luminescent in the solid state at room temperature and at 77 K, with no change in λemmax. The complex
exhibits reversible vapochromic behavior upon exposure to methylene chloride vapors, changing color from red
(5-R) to green (5-G). The shift to higher energy in the emission maximum from 654 to 514 nm is the largest
vapochromic shift (140 nm) yet reported. The [Pt(TPPPB)Cl]Cl complex exhibits high selectivity for certain volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) including methylene chloride, ethanol, ethyl acetate, and acetonitrile. The crystal structures
of both the green and red forms have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In both forms, the cationic
Pt(II) complex possesses the anticipated square-planar coordination geometry that is distorted as a consequence
of constraints from the terpyridyl binding. Analysis of the crystal packing of the green form (5-G) reveals the
presence of non-interacting Pt···Pt separations with distances of 3.9092(9) and 4.5483(11) Å and a zigzag
arrangement between neighboring Pt(II) ions. The red form (5-R) contains complexes that are stacked with Pt···Pt
separations of 3.2981(14) and 3.3427(14) Å, indicative of metallophilic interaction. The change in the emitting
state, as a consequence of the effect of the volatile organic compounds, results from a disruption of the d8−d8
metallophilic interactions in the red form and its metal−metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MMLCT) excited state to a
more-localized Pt(dπ)-to-tpy(π*) metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited state in the green form.",American Chemical Society,1/7/2008,2008,Pingwu Du; Jacob Schneider; William W.

While evidence of genes and developmental pathways underlying craniofacial shape determination is accumulating, we are still far from understanding how such variation at the genetic level is translated into craniofacial shape variation. Here we used 3D geometric morphometrics to map genes involved in shape determination in a population of outbred mice (Carworth Farms White, or CFW). We defined shape traits via principal component analysis of 3D skull and mandible measurements. We mapped genetic loci associated with shape traits at ~80,000 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms in ~700 male mice. We found that craniofacial shape and size are highly heritable, polygenic traits. Despite the polygenic nature of the traits, we identified 17 loci that explain variation in skull shape, and 8 loci associated with variation in mandible shape. Together, the associated variants account for 11.4% of skull and 4.4% of mandible shape variation, however, the total additive genetic variance associated with phenotypic variation was estimated in ~45%. Candidate genes within the associated loci have known roles in craniofacial development; this includes 6 transcription factors and several regulators of bone developmental pathways. One gene, Mn1, has an unusually large effect on shape variation in our study. A knockout of this gene was previously shown to affect negatively the development of membranous bones of the cranial skeleton, and evolutionary analysis shows that the gene has arisen at the base of the bony vertebrates (Eutelostomi), where the ossified head first appeared. Therefore, Mn1 emerges as a key gene for both skull formation and within-population shape variation. Our study shows that it is possible to identify important developmental genes through genome-wide mapping of high-dimensional shape features in an outbred population.",Public Library of Science,11/2/2015,2015,Luisa F.

6048,6048,100,dataset.7751469,10.1371/journal.pone.0209095,Type VI collagen promotes lung epithelial cell spreading and wound-closure,"Basement membrane (BM) is an essential part of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that plays a crucial role in mechanical support and signaling to epithelial cells during lung development, homeostasis and repair. Abnormal composition and remodeling of the lung ECM have been associated with developmental abnormalities observed in multiple pediatric and adult respiratory diseases. Collagen VI (COL6) is a well-studied muscle BM component, but its role in the lung and its effect on pulmonary epithelium is largely undetermined. We report the presence of COLVI immediately subjacent to human airway and alveolar epithelium in the pediatric lung, in a location where it is likely to interact with epithelial cells. In vitro, both primary human lung epithelial cells and human lung epithelial cell lines displayed an increased rate of “wound healing” in response to a scratch injury when plated on COL6 as compared to other matrices. For the 16HBE cell line, wounds remained >5-fold larger for cells on COL1 (p<0.001) and >6-fold larger on matrigel (p<0.001), a prototypical basement membrane, when compared to COL6 (>96% closure at 10 hr). The effect of COL6 upon lung epithelial cell phenotype was associated with an increase in cell spreading. Three hours after initial plating, 16HBE cells showed >7-fold less spreading on matrigel (p<0.01), and >4-fold less spreading on COL1 (p<0.01) when compared to COL6. Importantly, the addition of COL6 to other matrices also enhanced cell spreading. Similar responses were observed for primary cells. Inhibitor studies indicated both integrin β1 activity and activation of multiple signaling pathways was required for enhanced spreading on all matrices, with the PI3K/AKT pathway (PI3K, CDC42, RAC1) showing both significant and specific effects for spreading on COL6. Genetic gain-of-function experiments demonstrated enhanced PI3K/AKT pathway activity was sufficient to confer equivalent cell spreading on other matrices as compared to COL6. We conclude that COL6 has significant and specific effects upon human lung epithelial cell-autonomous functions.",Public Library of Science,12/14/2018,2018,Jared A.

Models of Integrated Multiomics
Data","Multiomics profiling
provides a holistic picture of a condition
being examined and captures the complexity of signaling events, beginning
from the original cause (environmental or genetic), to downstream
functional changes at multiple molecular layers. Pathway enrichment
analysis has been used with multiomics data sets to characterize signaling
mechanisms. However, technical and biological variability between
these layered data  limit an integrative computational analyses. We
present a Boolean network-based method, multiomics Boolean Omics Network
Invariant-Time Analysis (mBONITA), to integrate
omics data sets that quantify multiple molecular layers. mBONITA utilizes prior knowledge networks to perform
topology-based pathway analysis. In addition, mBONITA identifies genes that are consistently modulated across molecular
measurements by combining observed fold-changes and variance, with
a measure of node (i.e., gene or protein) influence over signaling,
and a measure of the strength of evidence for that gene across data
sets. We used mBONITA to integrate multiomics
data sets from RAMOS B cells treated with the immunosuppressant drug
cyclosporine A under varying O2 tensions to identify pathways
involved in hypoxia-mediated chemotaxis. We compare mBONITA’s performance with 6 other pathway analysis methods designed
for multiomics data and show that mBONITA identifies
a set of pathways with evidence of modulation across all omics layers. mBONITA is freely available at https://github.com/Thakar-Lab/mBONITA.",American Chemical Society,3/31/2023,2023,"Mukta

Stronger intermolecular interaction and intact three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded
networks were formed only in crystal 1c, which were essential
for preventing slippage of molecular layers and generating ML; the
other molecules were either lacking π–π interactions

Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is a pro-fibrotic mediator that directly and indirectly influences the activation of myofibroblasts. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) promotes the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, and can be regulated by IL-13. However, IL-13’s downstream signaling pathways are not completely understood. We previously reported that the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is upregulated in fibroblasts treated with TGF-β and in the lungs of mice and patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, YY1 directly regulates collagen and alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression in fibroblasts. However, it is not known if IL-13 regulates fibroblast activation through YY1 expression. We hypothesize that IL-13 up-regulates YY1 expression through regulation of AKT activation, leading to fibroblast activation. In this study we found that YY1 was upregulated by IL-13 in lung fibroblasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner, resulting in increased α-SMA. Conversely, knockdown of YY1 blocked IL-13-induced α-SMA expression in fibroblasts. Furthermore, AKT phosphorylation was increased in fibroblasts treated with IL-13, and AKT overexpression upregulated YY1, whereas blockade of AKT phosphorylation suppressed the induction of YY1 by IL-13 in vitro. In vivo YY1 was upregulated in fibrotic lungs from CC10-IL-13 transgenic mice compared to that from wild-type littermates, which was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that IL-13 is a potent stimulator and activator of fibroblasts, at least in part, through AKT-mediated YY1 activation.",Public Library of Science,3/16/2015,2015,Jia Guo; Hongwei Yao; Xin Lin; Haodong Xu; David Dean; Zhou Zhu; Gang Liu; Patricia Sime,pub.1035210063,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/data_set/dataset.8654597,https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/_IL_13_Induces_YY1_through_the_AKT_Pathway_in_Lung_Fibroblasts_/1336887,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,Lung; Rare Diseases,,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,Biomedical,Basic Science,Lung Cancer,1.3 Cancer Initiation: Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes; 1.4 Cancer Progression and Metastasis,

Our estimation exploits the relative expenditure of high- and low-income households on luxuries versus necessities. This double differencing corrects for measurement error that can vary over time by good and income.

In the male germline of Drosophila melanogaster, a novel but poorly understood form of sex chromosome-specific transcriptional regulation occurs that is distinct from canonical sex chromosome dosage compensation or meiotic inactivation. Previous work shows that expression of reporter genes driven by testis-specific promoters is considerably lower—approximately 3-fold or more—for transgenes inserted into X chromosome versus autosome locations. Here we characterize this transcriptional suppression of X-linked genes in the male germline and its evolutionary consequences. Using transgenes and transpositions, we show that most endogenous X-linked genes, not just testis-specific ones, are transcriptionally suppressed several-fold specifically in the Drosophila male germline. In wild-type testes, this sex chromosome-wide transcriptional suppression is generally undetectable, being effectively compensated by the gene-by-gene evolutionary recruitment of strong promoters on the X chromosome. We identify and experimentally validate a promoter element sequence motif that is enriched upstream of the transcription start sites of hundreds of testis-expressed genes; evolutionarily conserved across species; associated with strong gene expression levels in testes; and overrepresented on the X chromosome. These findings show that the expression of X-linked genes in the Drosophila testes reflects a balance between chromosome-wide epigenetic transcriptional suppression and long-term compensatory adaptation by sex-linked genes. Our results have broad implications for the evolution of gene expression in the Drosophila male germline and for genome evolution.",Public Library of Science,7/12/2016,2016,Emily L.

The photoirradiation of Tp′Rh(PR3)H2 (1a,b) in acetonitrile at room temperature afforded the complexes Tp′Rh(PR3)(CH2CN)H (3a,b), by the selective oxidative addition of the primary C−H bond of acetonitrile to the [Tp′Rh(PR3)] fragment generated by the dehydrogenation of 1. The thermal reactions of Tp′Rh(PMe3)(Ph)H (2a) or Tp′Rh(κ2-C6H4-2-PMe2)H (2b) in acetonitrile at 80 °C also resulted in the formation of 3a and 3b, respectively, by the oxidative addition of the C−H bond to the [Tp′Rh(PR3)] fragment, generated by the reductive elimination of benzene (from 2a) or intramolecular reductive elimination of the PPhMe2 ligand (from 2b). Heating the isolated C−H bond activated complexes 3a,b in acetonitrile at higher temperature (100 °C) for longer times (≈5 days) resulted in the formation of the corresponding C−CN bond activated complexes, Tp′Rh(PR3)(CH3)(CN) (4a,b), respectively. The molecular structures of the C−H activated product 3a,b (kinetic product) and C−CN activated product 4a,b (thermodynamic product) were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and X-ray crystallographic analysis. Furthermore, the secondary C−H bond activated product of succinonitrile, Tp′Rh(PMe3)[CH(CN)CH2CN]H (5), was isolated by the thermal reaction of 2a with succinonitrile (20 equiv) at 100 °C, and the molecular structure was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallographic analysis.

None of these approaches is totally effective and our ability to control seizures remains limited and complicated by frequent side effects. The emerging revolutionary technique of optogenetics enables manipulation of the activity of specific neuronal populations in vivo with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution using light. We used optogenetic approaches to test the role of hippocampal excitatory neurons in the lithium-pilocarpine model of acute elicited seizures in awake behaving rats. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons were transduced in vivo with a virus carrying an enhanced halorhodopsin (eNpHR), a yellow light activated chloride pump, and acute seizure progression was then monitored behaviorally and electrophysiologically in the presence and absence of illumination delivered via an optical fiber. Inhibition of those neurons with illumination prior to seizure onset significantly delayed electrographic and behavioral initiation of status epilepticus, and altered the dynamics of ictal activity development. These results reveal an essential role of hippocampal excitatory neurons in this model of ictogenesis and illustrate the power of optogenetic approaches for elucidation of seizure mechanisms. This early success in controlling seizures also suggests future therapeutic avenues.",Public Library of Science,4/24/2013,2013,Inna Sukhotinsky; Alexander M. Chan; Omar J. Ahmed; Vikram R.
